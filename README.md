# ImageCropperWebBuild

Well...

I figured out the bug.

GitHub pages only hosts 'static' pages. I cannot make POST requests and such, I cannot serve the files I wish to serve, I cannot upload the files I wish to upload.

All is lost, all is in vain, give up on free website hosting... 

At least it works if I include the file in the repository, I hope you get the idea.
